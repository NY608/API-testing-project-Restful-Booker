# API-testing-project-Restful-Booker
This is the API document to Restful Booker -https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html#api-Auth-CreateToken
The RESTful Booker API is a hotel reservation system that allows users to interact with different endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete bookings.
The project includes a wide range of test scenarios, including positive and negative test cases, to cover all aspects of the RESTful Booker API.
I have tested the CRUD operation for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE with Basic Auth / Cookie Bases Auth.
